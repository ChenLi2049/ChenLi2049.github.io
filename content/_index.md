## Hi there! 😺

This is Chen Li (李琛)'s personal website, where I talk about Physics, Computer Science, and films. (Yes, the number in the URL comes from _Blade Runner 2049_, a sequel lives up to its potential.)

This personal website is kind of like browser bookmarks that I can check when needed. Also, by writing something down, I think through the subject more clearly. And it's nice to put some takeaways out there so that other people can benefit from it too.

I'm working on a bachelor's degree in Physics, at Wuhan University.
