Hi there! 😺<img class="avatar" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122166030?s=400&v=4" alt="avatar">

This is Chen Li (李琛)'s personal website, where I talk about Physics, Programming, and Films. (Yes, the number in the URL comes from _Blade Runner 2049_, a sequel lives up to its potential.) This personal website is kind of like browser bookmarks that I can check when needed. Also, by writing something down, I think through the subject more clearly. And it's nice to put some takeaways out there so that other people can benefit from it too.

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working under the guidance of Professor Francis Halzen.
