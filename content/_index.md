This is Chen Li (李琛)'s personal website, where I talk about Physics, Computer Science, and films. (Yes, the number in my name comes from _Blade Runner 2049_, a sequel live up to its potential. )

I'm working on a bachelor's degree in Physics, in Wuhan University.

The website is currently unfinished, I'm still working on it.
