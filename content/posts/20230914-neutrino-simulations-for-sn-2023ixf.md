Neutrinos emitted from a supernova can be simulated, see [the article on astrobites](https://astrobites.org/2023/09/14/nu-models-to-study-a-new-supernova/) and the paper [[2306.14717] _Low and High Energy Neutrinos from SN 2023ixf in M101_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14717).

About multi-messenger (for more information, see [[2307.14559] _TXS 0506+056 with Updated IceCube Data_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14559)):

This simulation followed the hypothesis "core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe)".

And the result of the paper:
- Low-energy neutrinos: Super-K reports no significant detection, which supports the conclusions of this paper. Also, this supernova would likely not be detectable by Hyper-K.
- High-energy neutrinos: IceCube reports no significant detection, which is probably because
    - only a small fraction (less than about 10%) of the kinetic energy is used to accelerate particles.
    - the jet lasts a long time.
    - it is highly relativistic.
