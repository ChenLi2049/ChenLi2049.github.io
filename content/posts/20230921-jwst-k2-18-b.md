[Webb Discovers Methane, Carbon Dioxide in Atmosphere of K2-18 b | NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/2023/webb-discovers-methane-carbon-dioxide-in-atmosphere-of-k2-18b) and many other news say K2-18 b is promising for life. What I like about these news is that they tell the readers what "Spectrum" is, which is a kind of science popularization. And the spectra of K2-18 b shows there exists Methane and Carbon Dioxide in its atmosphere. Thus life is promising.

On the contrary, the Mexico alien is a shocking picture, which turned out be a cake.[^1] And the source of information (Jaime Maussan) is not reliable, as he had reported lots of fake aliens in the past.

No doubt the latter one is much more popular in the public. And I don't like it.

[^1]: As GLaDOS said, "cake is a lie".
