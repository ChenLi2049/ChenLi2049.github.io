Besides writing code, having ChatGPT pretend to be Robin from [_How I Met Your Mother_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother) and engaging in a conversation with her is so funny. She is constantly making things up and I am trying my best to make the story work. And when it does, it's amazing!

It's even more fun to ask ChatGPT to be Jamie Lannister, since there is a whole novel and countless Reddit discussions. We fought about whether Joffrey is his bastard for more that half an hour. There is even a duel.

Can't wait to try this on GPT-4. Maybe I should build my own LLM and put in the scripts of _How I Met Your Mother_.

But one of my favorite Sci-Fi writers of all time, Ted Chiang, shut my idea down. In the article [_ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web_](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web),[^1] he claimed that LLMs are not going to create something genuinely new that is not blurry or too general. I am getting the feeling that we just create a robot that produces something trash-ish, which could be useful when you're stuck in a bug or just wanna have some fun or want to read something as fast as possible[^2] or want to [write papers as fast as possible](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-04-02/one-of-the-worlds-most-cited-scientists-rafael-luque-suspended-without-pay-for-13-years.html), but is useless when you are considering the next step of your project or want to talk to Robin herself. In the movie [_Her_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/), ChatGPT is Theodore rather than Samantha.[^3]

[^1]: Publishing on _The New Yorker_ is so old-fashioned.
[^2]: I did _not_ ask ChatGPT to summarize Ted Chiang's article for me. My conscious is clean. :)
[^3]: I like how the movie potrayed the idea of [Anima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus) by the way.
