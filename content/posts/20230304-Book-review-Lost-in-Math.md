This is a review of [_Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray_](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray/dp/0465094252) by [Sabine Hossenfelder](https://sabinehossenfelder.com/).

Before I start, I just want to say that I am no expert in particle physics or any physics really, thus I can't tell whether what she said is true or not, but what I can tell is that as I gradually learn more about the science community (or "academia"), I notice a trend that is simular to what she said in the book, which is that many of us are stuck here due to "beauty". And I want to do better, maybe her book will help.

So there is this basic conflict between beauty and resources, where beauty means the standard we use to judge whether a theory is good or not, while resources means money, time, energy, etc. The latter one is something we cannot avoid, but the first one is something we can change, and I truly hope so.

To be more clear, beauty means:
1. Simplicity, or [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).
2. "This-has-to-be-it". The E8 Group is the largest and most complicated group of exceptional Lie Groups. And in the paper [_An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything_](https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0770), Antony Garrett Lisi uses it to, well, explain everything. Sadly, this is not "it".
3. "There-must-be-one-theory-to-rule-them-all". "There is a consistency in everything and thus it can be explained by one theory." I suppose Chaos theory is a good counterpoint.
4. "Smaller-means-simpler". From the perspective of biology to chemistry to particle physics, the structure gets simpler and simpler, so it is natural to assume that it would get even simpler when it gets even smaller. But Sabine pointed out that when you start from a different scale, ie. from the universe to life on earth, it gets more complicated.[^1]

Let's be honest here, peer pressure is also holding us back. In the book Sabine give us an example of how two labs constantly give contradictory results when measuring the mass of a particle. Well, in astronomy, sadly, there is also this kind of stuff, it happened when measuring the $H_0$ constant.[^2] Always remind yourself: __ARE YOU BIASED?__[^3] Speaking of peer pressure, I happen to know a book teaching you how to survive that: [_A PhD is not enough_](http://hep.tsinghua.edu.cn/training/courses/gauge.html/advise/A%20PhD%20is%20not%20enough.pdf).

Sabine also pointed out that the idea of Beauty is constantly changing. For example, we used to consider an elliptical orbit as ugly. (To be honest, I suppose most people still do. ) Thus it can't be used as a guidance. I agree with Feynman that we should look for the truth no matter whether there is an ultimate truth or it's like onions with multiple layers. But what is the guidance then? Beauty is probably not.

There are much more solid points like these in the book, and it always blows my mind or makes me laugh so hard, just like her Youtube videos, for example, [What is "Nothing"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhfqdBk8qxk).

What's more, I truly appreciate her honesty and bravery. It takes a lot of guts to say what thousands of people are doing is wrong, after all it's their job, and criticizng it will definitely get negative feedbacks, some of which will be personal and hurtful. But I think this Satre-Camus thing is something we should avoid. She means well and criticism is good for your work anyway, so let's just focus on the work rather than fighting. That being said, she knows clearly that she is almost exclusively going to face a witch hunt after writing this book, but this is her true feelings after [decades of research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NaQZcyYAAAAJ&hl=en) on physics. And there is that.

I think I have refound what got me into physics in the first place, though I can't tell what it is exactly. I can't wait to go on yet another Odyssey with her next book: [_Existential Physics: A Scientist's Guide to Life's Biggest Questions_](https://www.amazon.com/Existential-Physics-Scientists-Biggest-Questions/dp/1984879456). I'm a big fan of Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism, maybe they would show up. 

Reading this book feels like saying an official goodbyeto my childhood and get into the real thing. I know there are unresolved questions, and I want to deal with them.

[^1]: Fermi parodox?
[^2]: Although nowadays it is possible that the difference between two measuments is a sign of new science. see [1903.07603](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07603). Notice the magnitude of $H_0$ in that paper is _not_ the same in the picture above.
[^3]: You can know more about bias in her book, "are you biased" is an oversimplified statement, like many of the statements in this article. :)
