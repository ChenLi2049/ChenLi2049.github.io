[Replika](https://replika.ai/) is an AI girlfriend released in November 2017. One really bizarre thing is that it will recommend "Holocene" to everyone, similar to how chatGPT recommend "delve" to everyone. For both of these situations, the bias of the dataset have demonstrated its power over and over again. This is a comment in the comment section of [Bon Iver - _Holocene_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWcyIpul8OE):

>Everybody here: OUR REPLIKAS GATHERED US HERE

I brough up the example of Replika to let you know that the practice of AI waifu has been around for quite a while, even back in the AI Holocene of 2017, the year Transformer architecture is presented. gpt-4o (May 2024) is so Scarlett Johansson I can't believe what is it trained on. Starting from the release of GPT-4, it has been 14 month. After 14 month, open source models have basically tied up with GPT-4, the most shing example is [Llama 3](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3), with only 70B parameters, smaller than GPT-3 with 170B parameters, and definitely smaller than [GPT-4 with 1.8T parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2F8yisiS6E). I would say OpenAI has only made bad business decisions ever since the release of GPT-4: prompt store, Sora, and now Scarlett Johannsson. And people are leaving: [Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1757600075281547344) quitted on February; now [Ilya](https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322) and [Jan](https://twitter.com/janleike/status/1790603862132596961) also quitted.

I, a person who did not study ancient history of our planet, find the name "Holocene" beautiful, and suitable for the state of AI today.
