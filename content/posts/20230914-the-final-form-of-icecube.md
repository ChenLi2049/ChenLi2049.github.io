So I had a dream last night. If infinite money and energy is provided and pollution will not be created, the final form of IceCube is in space, so that atmospheric neutrinos and geoneutrinos can be neglected.

I guess there are two places to implement PMTs:

- Water launched by rockets, then covered with sheet (to avoid evaporation), which will quickly become ice in space. Or just ice at the beginning.
- One of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn that contains water. For example, Ganymede.

If possible, I want the distances between PMTs is the same and forms a Primitive  
Cubic (borrowing the concept from Solid State Physics), so that we can perform 3D convolution.

"IceCube-GenZ" would be a good name.
