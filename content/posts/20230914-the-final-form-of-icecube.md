So I had a dream last night. If infinite money and energy is provided and pollution will not be created, the final form of IceCube is in space, so that atmospheric neutrinos and geoneutrinos can be neglected.

I guess there are two places to implement PMTs:

- Water launched by rockets, then covered with sheet (to avoid evaporation), which will quickly become ice in space. Or just ice at the beginning.
- One of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn that contains water. For example, Ganymede.

"IceCube-GenZ" would be a good name.
