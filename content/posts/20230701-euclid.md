See [ESA - Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid). Some of the stories are really exciting.

In general, this is a telescope observing visible light (530-920 nm) and near-infrared (920-2020 nm). And yes, the near-infrared is observed with CCD.

Goal: light $\rightarrow$ gravitational lensing $\rightarrow$ dark matter distribution.

By the way, you can only launch 600 of these everyday.

[ESA - _Euclid's first images: the dazzling edge of darkness_](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid/Euclid_s_first_images_the_dazzling_edge_of_darkness) shows a wide Field of View (FoV), compared with JWST. The advantage of a wide FoV is that the distance and location could be meausured more precisely, thus locate dark matter and dark energy more precisely.
