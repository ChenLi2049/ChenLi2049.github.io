See [ESA - Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid). Some of the stories are really exciting.

In general, this is a telescope observing visible light (530-920 nm) and near-infrared (920-2020 nm). And yes, the near-infrared is observed with CCD.

Goal: light $\rightarrow$ gravitational lensing $\rightarrow$ dark matter distribution.

By the way, you can only launch 600 of these everyday.
