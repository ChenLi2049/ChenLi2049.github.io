[MojoðŸ”¥](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/) is magic. Check out this interview with the founder of Mojo: [Chris Lattner: Future of Programming and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #381 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdJQ8iVTwj8). Integrated with python and using multiple CPU/GPU/TPU is unbelievable.

I think the name is actually kinda cool. Though I'm sure when it's released (fingers crossed), someone will fork it and name it Dojo, or Casa, or House.[^1]
