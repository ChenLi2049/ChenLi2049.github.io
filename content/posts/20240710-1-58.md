[Sabine mentioned today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xfv5NNPbLs) that the "dimension" of __fractal__ is $log{(\frac{3}{2})} \approx 1.58$, which reminds me about this LLM quantization method called [BitNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764) with ternary {-1, 0, 1} parameter thus 1.58 bit. I would assume the only connection here is just the number.
