___Spoiler Alert!___

This article is a comparision between [_There Will Be Blood_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/), [_A Brighter Summer Day_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/) and _Evangelion_ (Only [_TV_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112159/) and [_Old film_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169858/) this time). We should talk about why good things are good instead of why bad things are bad, because what really matters is [the good, not the bad, or the ugly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/). This three films/anime are the best work I have watched and I want to know why I like them. Although these works come from different culture, they have a lot in common.

Before I start, I want to mention that a director is a lot like a science researcher. You can see consistency in their work, and directing films is like publishing papers, winning awards publishing on _Nature_. But I'll talk about [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur) in another article. For this reason, I will not talk about the [_Rebuild of  Evangelion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuild_of_Evangelion) for now, although I have to say that I have rather complicated feelings about it.

I believe every good piece of media has the potential to become a [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_genre). And when we talk about genres, we are actually talking about elements we see. So here is list of elenments that I see in this new genre. The table below is largely inspired by [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelionmemes/comments/84gbva/conflict_in_evangelion/):

I am not symtematically trained in films, and all my knowledge are from random places, so maybe there isn't such a similarity, it's just that all good stuffs have these point in common. Although the 5 "vs."s may be universal, the latter ones are not universal, I guess.

This article is currently unfinished, maybe these works have something in common in storyline, composition, etc. But I'll need a rewatch to remind myself.
