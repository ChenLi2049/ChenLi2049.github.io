This article is a comparision between [_There Will Be Blood_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/), [_A Bright Summer Day_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101985/) and _Evangelion_ (Only [_TV_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112159/) and [_Old film_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169858/) this time). We should talk about why good things are good instead of why bad things are bad, because what really matters is [the good, not the bad or the ugly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/). This three films/anime are the best work I have watched and I want to know why I like them.

Before I start, I want to mention that a director is a lot like a science researcher. You can see an consistance in their work, and directing flims is like publishing papers, winning awards publishing on _Nature_. But I'll talk about [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur) some other time. For this reason, I will not talk about the [_Rebuild of  Evangelion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuild_of_Evangelion) for now, although I have to say that I have rather complicated feeling about that.
