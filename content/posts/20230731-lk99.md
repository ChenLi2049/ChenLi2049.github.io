[LK99](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008) is supposed to be room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor.

To me, the big leap from room-temperature, super-high pressure superconductor to room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor is not plausible. Maybe I'm being conservative, but according to my understanding that's not how these kind of things work.

This overview table is really helpful in tracking replications: [Claims of Room Temperature and Ambient Pressure Superconductor | Page 13 | SpaceBattles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/claims-of-room-temperature-and-ambient-pressure-superconductor.1106083/page-13).

On social media, this is really popular, because this is something everybody can understand. It's like that "is Pluto a planet" thing again. There's this meme where the supposed superconductor's resistance is measured by an everyday electronic multimeter, which is really funny.
