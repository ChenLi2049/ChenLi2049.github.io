In this article, I want to explain why [Bon Iver](https://boniver.org/)'s first album _For Emma, Forever Ago_ is great in the perspective of physics. They're not necessarily true but I just think this is fun.

1. He uses different voice when saying. It's nothing like the way he talks or how he used to sing. You can say that his voice opened a new vision for us. Can you imagine seeing infrared with your own eyes for the first time?

2. First we break the voice down with Fourier transformation:$$x(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-i \omega t} \space \text{d}t, \tag{1}$$then if we use inverse Fourier transformation, we will get the original sound $$x(t) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\omega) e^{i \omega t} \space \text{d} \omega. \tag{2}$$But if you add a random number on $x(\omega)$ and use inverse Fourier transform to put it back, we will get: $$x^{\prime}(t) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x(\omega)+ \text{random}) e^{i \omega t} \space \text{d} \omega \tag{3}$$or just pick out few frequencies and emphasize them, that's probably how these songs sound like.

    In this way, you can say that his music is the build-up and relief or tension.

3. Revolutionizing Folk music, one of the oldest and probably the most popular pop music genre, is big. It's like revolutionizing Newton's law. They are still the same elements, but it felt different.
