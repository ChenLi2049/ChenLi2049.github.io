X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is an X-ray space telescope. On the same rocket there's also Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM), a moon landing project.

XRISM's predecessor Hitomi was launched on 17 February 2016 and contact was lost on 26 March 2016, due to malfunction of the attitude control system. After which, a lot changed. For example, [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01611) explained the team management of XRISM, which is like an analogue of government system.

And here's a [presentation](https://github.com/ChenLi2049/ChenLi2049/blob/main/presentations/20220815_G1Presentation_XRISM.pptx) from my group project last summer, which is a quick introduction to XRISM. I do (not) miss using Microsoft PPT, those were simpler times.

It's a bit weird that writing about something makes you care about it more. I mean, I did not participate in the manufacturing process or anything. I guess this is also one of the meanings of this blog.

XRISM, hang in there! Wow this is a pun. So, um ... SLIM, don't?
