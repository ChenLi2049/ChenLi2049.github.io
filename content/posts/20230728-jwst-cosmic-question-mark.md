So there's a question mark in the deep sky, see [James Webb Space Telescope Feed Post (jwstfeed.com)](https://jwstfeed.com/PostView/FeedPost?ci=1690584124_james-webb-space-telescope-question-mark-galaxy-photo).

Humans are pattern finding CNNs. And sometimes it's funny.

Similar to the face on Mars, see [Cydonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_(Mars)), the magic and the hype would go away with higher resolution. But higher resolution provides a different kind of magic, see [JWTS Uranus](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Webb_scores_another_ringed_world_with_new_image_of_Uranus).
