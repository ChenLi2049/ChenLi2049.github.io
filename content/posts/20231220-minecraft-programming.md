These are probably trivial but important experiences to me: 

- Go on mcbbs (a website taken down forever now) for mods, modpacks, texture packs, saves and skins is simular to go on GitHub.
- Update for Minecraft versions is simular to update for Python versions. In Minecraft, 1.8 -> 1.9 is painful. In Python, 2.x -> 3.x is painful.
- In Minecraft, 64 is the number in a set of items. In PyTorch, we also use $2^n$.
- Redstone, however, is just a terrible way of programming. Whenever I do redstone, I just want to go do programming instead.
