Another gravestone on [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

Technically it's not shut down, it's gonna be integrated with YouTube Music. So after YouTube Shorts, which is similar to TikTok, YouTube will start promoting music services now. Instead of using that, I'm starting to go through open source podcast apps on GitHub.

Since you can also subscribe things on Google Podcasts with RSS, I consider its shut down the splash of Google Reader's death. This sentence from [Wikipedia page about Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) is ironic:

>In January 2007 Google added video content from YouTube and Google Video to Reader.

Why does every app wants to combine everything in the world? WeiXin did that and it takes about 1 TB of storage in your phone.

I really hope "Shuts Down" will not become a series in my posts. That would be sad.
