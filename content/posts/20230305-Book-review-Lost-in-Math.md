This is a review of [_Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray_](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray/dp/0465094252), written by [Sabine Hossenfelder](https://sabinehossenfelder.com/).

So there is this basic conflict between beauty and resources, where beauty means the standard we use to judge whether a theory is good or not, while resources means money, time, energy, etc. The latter one is something we cannot avoid, but the first one is something we can change, and I truly hope so.

To be more clear, beauty means:
1. Simplicity, or [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).
2. "This-has-to-be-it". The [E8 Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_(mathematics) is the largest and most complicated group of exceptional Lie Groups. And in the paper [_An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything_](https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0770), Antony Garrett Lisi uses it to, well, explain everything. Sadly, this is not "it".
3. "There-must-be-one-theory-to-rule-them-all". "There is a consistance in everything and thus it can be explained by one theory." I suppose Chaos thoery is good point agianst that.
4. "Smaller-means-simpler". From the perspective of biology to chemistry to particle physics, the structure gets simpler and simpler, so it is natural to assume that it would get even simpler when it gets even smaller. But in the book Sabine pointed out that when you start from a different scale, ie. from the universe to life on earth, it gets more complicated.[^1]
5. Let's be honest here, peer pressure. In the book Sabine give us an example of how two labs constantly give contradictory results when measuring the mass of a particle. Well, in astronomy, sadly, there is also this kind of stuff, it happened when measuring the $H_0$ constant.[^2] Always remind yourself: __DO YOU HAVE BIAS?__[^3] Speaking of peer pressure, I know a great book teaching you how to survive that: [_A PhD is not enough_](http://hep.tsinghua.edu.cn/training/courses/gauge.html/advise/A%20PhD%20is%20not%20enough.pdf).
6. She pointed out that the idea of Beauty is constantly changing. For example, we used to consider an elliptical orbit as ugly. (To be honest, I suppose most people still do. ) Thus it can't be used as a guidance. I agree with Feynman that we should look for the truth no matter whether there is an ultimate truth or it's like onions with multiple layers. But what is the guidance then? Beauty is probably not.

There are much more solid points like these in the book, and it always blows my mind or makes me laugh so hard, just like her youtube videos, for example, [What is "Nothing"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhfqdBk8qxk).

What's more, I truly appreciate her honesty and bravery. She knows clearly that she is almost exclusively going to face a witch hunt after writing this book, but this is her true feelings after decades of research on particle physics. And there is that.

I think I have refound what got me into physics in the first place, though I can't tell what it is exactly. I can't wait to go on yet another Odyssey with her next book: [_Existential Physics: A Scientist's Guide to Life's Biggest Questions_](https://www.amazon.com/Existential-Physics-Scientists-Biggest-Questions/dp/1984879456). I'm a big fan of Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism, maybe they would show up. 

I know there are a lot of questions, and I want to deal with them.

[^1]: Fermi parodox?
[^2]: Although nowadays it is possible that the difference bewteen two measuments is a sign of new science. see [1903.07603](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07603). Notice the magnitude of $H_0$ in that paper is _not_ the same in the picture above.
[^3]: I guess Deep Learning is kind of like using bias?
