This picture (from [LGalaxiesPublicRelease.github.io](https://github.com/LGalaxiesPublicRelease/LGalaxiesPublicRelease.github.io)) is iconic.

[MillenniumTNG](https://www.mtng-project.org/) is cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, which is the upgrade of IllustrisTNG combined with Millennium.

In Sec. 3.3 of [[2304.12338] _The MillenniumTNG Project: The impact of baryons and massive neutrinos on high-resolution weak gravitational lensing convergence maps_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12338), the simulation of massive neutrino is explained. This is the first time that neutrino is introduced to the simulation.
