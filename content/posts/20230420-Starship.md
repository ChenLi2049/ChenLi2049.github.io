Well, I'm not in defense of Elon, and I know he's done plenty of controversial things. But the truth is, the mission did not "fail". It's kind of like this rocket is meant to explode. Usually, there are [several steps for this trip](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0516/SpaceX-launch-A-step-by-step-guide). This time, few engines were out, thus the first and second stages failed to separate. This is only the second or third step in the entire trip. The data collected in this mission, especially when we make the rocket intentionally took those few tumbles, will be used for future tests.

The biggest advantage of Starship is its cheapness, one of the reasons is that it's made of several pieces of stainless steel. I know, crazy. If promising, it will only cost 100k dollars for one person. Compared to the 60s when we went to the moon for the first time, this is much cheaper and could be affordable to companies and even individuals.

So, do I want to go to the moon or Mars?

Yes! However, my interest is just not planetary astronomy, and there's no observatory on the moon or Mars. (Not yet anyway.) So maybe I'll do it later, and I hope it works by that time.
