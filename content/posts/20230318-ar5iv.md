Reading papers on [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/) or [arXiv Vanity](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/), or reading in the HTML format to be precisely, is so convenient. I enjoy the flexibility and copying formula the most.

This reminds me of an article: [_Ideas on A Really Fast Statistics Journal_](https://yihui.org/en/2012/03/a-really-fast-statistics-journal/). If we use Markdown instead of a pdf file as the format in papers, ar5iv wouldn't even have to exist, and things would be much easier for me. But this might be the best solution we have, because safety over speed I suppose.
