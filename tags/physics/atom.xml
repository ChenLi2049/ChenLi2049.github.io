They&amp;rsquo;re not necessarily true but I just think this is fun.
He uses different voice when saying. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing like the way he talk or how he used to sing. You can say that his voice opened a new vision for us. Can you imagine seeing infrared with your own eyes for the first time?</description></item><item><title>LIGO O4: multi-messenger</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230514-ligo-o4-multi-messenger/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230514-ligo-o4-multi-messenger/</guid><description>LIGO is back on track with Observing Run 4 (O4)1. And I got this idea:
Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) is considered as a Gravitational Wave (GW) candidate that can be detected by LIGO-Virgo-Kagra2. And IceCube recently proposed a method to combine neutrino detection with radio detection in the observation of AGN3. So maybe these three messengers (GW, neutrino, radio) can work together to observe AGN. And maybe we should write a program that can synchronize these observations.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230501-book-review-love-and-math-the-heart-of-hidden-reality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230501-book-review-love-and-math-the-heart-of-hidden-reality/</guid><description>This is a review of Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward Frenkel.
This book is about love, or Langlands program, or the generality of group theory, or beauty. Most of the content feels like text book to me, such as Discrete Groups, Group Representation, etc.
Unlike physics, it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to write math popularization. I can quickly get what he is talking about because I&amp;rsquo;m learning Group Theory this semester.</description></item><item><title>Starship</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230420-starship/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230420-starship/</guid><description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not in defense of Elon, and I know he&amp;rsquo;s done plenty of controversial things. But the truth is, the mission did not &amp;ldquo;fail&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like this rocket is meant to explode. Usually, there are several steps for this trip. This time, few engines were out, thus the first and second stages failed to separate. This is only the second or third step in the entire trip. The data collected in this mission, especially when we make the rocket intentionally took those few tumbles, will be used for future tests.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Boojums All the Way Through: Communicating Science in a Prosaic Age</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230416-book-review-boojums-all-the-way-through/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230416-book-review-boojums-all-the-way-through/</guid><description>This is a review of Boojums All the Way Through: Communicating Science in a Prosaic Age by N. David Mermin. His most famous quote is &amp;ldquo;Shut up and calculate!&amp;rdquo; for anyone who is confused about Quantum Mechanics, which the same attitude I have when I&amp;rsquo;m trying different neural networks.
I find it funny that the 2nd article Commencement address feels like a personal attack to my How much energy does it take to hurt your feelings?</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Existential Physics: A Scientist's Guide to Life's Biggest Questions</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230406-book-review-existential-physics-a-scientists-guide-to-lifes-biggest-questions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230406-book-review-existential-physics-a-scientists-guide-to-lifes-biggest-questions/</guid><description>This is a review of Existential Physics: A Scientist&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Life&amp;rsquo;s Biggest Questions by Sabine Hossenfelder.
First of all, Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism did not show up in the book. Just so you know.
To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not quite interested in the topics she covered in the book. Well, I mean I am interested but not right away. These problems belong to the &amp;ldquo;important but not hurry&amp;rdquo; problems. What she talked about in the book, pseudoscience, is like what Jostein Gaarder talked about in the final chapters of Sophie&amp;rsquo;s World, which is about pseudo-philosophy.</description></item><item><title>Statistics 101</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230404-statistics-101/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230404-statistics-101/</guid><description>Before do the math, here&amp;rsquo;s things you should consider to avoid bias:
The magnitude of axis. $\log$? 2 quantities use separate axises? Dramatic? Duration of time. &amp;ldquo;Every Olympic is the best Olympic in the last 3 years.&amp;rdquo; Demography. Age, wealth, gender, race, etc. Does it cover all the target demography? From what media or institution. Different media have different biases themselves. (Although this statement is also a kind of bias.) For a more detailed research, see Machine-Learning media bias.</description></item><item><title>ar5iv</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230318-ar5iv/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230318-ar5iv/</guid><description>Reading papers on ar5iv or arXiv Vanity, or reading in the HTML format to be precise, is so convenient. I enjoy the flexibility and copying equations the most.
This reminds me of an article: Ideas on A Really Fast Statistics Journal. If we use Markdown instead of a pdf file as the format in papers, ar5iv wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have to exist, and things would be much easier for me. But this might be the best solution we have, because safety over speed I suppose.</description></item><item><title>How Much Energy Does It Take to Hurt Your Feelings?</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230314-how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-hurt-your-feelings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230314-how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-hurt-your-feelings/</guid><description>This article is about the work we do to get our feelings hurt1, the dimension of which is $[M^1 L^2 T^{-2}]$. And by &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;our&amp;rdquo;, I mean humanity, or the internet to be exact. This article is not about how our feelings get hurt at work, the dimension of which is $[Salary]$.
It&amp;rsquo;s (probably not) natural to write down the following equations: $$W_{FH}=N w_{FH}=N p_{FH} t_{FH} \tag{1}$$, where $N$ is the number of people we consider, $w_{FH}$ is the energy the brain takes to get a certain feeling, in this case, anger.</description></item><item><title>ฮด</title><link>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230314-delta-function/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ChenLi2049.github.io/posts/20230314-delta-function/</guid><description>It hit me that $\delta(x)$ and $\delta_{ij}$ are the same thing, they both mean &amp;ldquo;peak&amp;rdquo;, and $x=i-j$ or $x=\vert i-j \vert$.

ยง1 Astronomy 101 The first 6 chapters are Astronomy 101 to me. I have read about them in several textbooks, but when these clues forming a linear process, it&amp;rsquo;s something else. (I will come back to this &amp;ldquo;linear process&amp;rdquo; later in ยง2.)

Before I start, I just want to say that I am no expert in Particle Physics or any Physics really, thus I can&amp;rsquo;t tell whether what she said is true or not, but what I can tell is that as I gradually learn more about the science community (or &amp;ldquo;academia&amp;rdquo;), I notice a trend that is similar to what she said in the book, which is that many of us are stuck here due to &amp;ldquo;beauty&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
